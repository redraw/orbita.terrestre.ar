Simple real-time satellite tracker.

I'm a web dev passionate about space, joining pieces between Celestrak API, Leaflet, and [tle.js](https://github.com/davidcalhoun/tle.js) which wraps around [satellite.js](https://github.com/shashwatak/satellite-js) providing high-level methods to work with TLEs. If you know more about it or found a bug feel free to send a PR!
